#### Level :one:

```Exercice 1```

The aim of this is  to validate the forms on your website with Javascript. 
Note: forms are not validated with ALERTS !! Hint: Use the "is-invalid" class with Bootstrap 4.

- Validate the search form:
● Conditions: The word entered must be mandatory and contain more than 3 characters.

- Validate the login form (must have an email field and a password field):
● Conditions: Email and password fields must be required. The email must follow
the standard format of emails (There is a lot of documentation)

- Validate the registration form (at least you must have an email field, password,
password repeat and a province drop-down).
● We leave the validation conditions in your hands.
